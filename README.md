I’m a Full Stack Developer who's made beautiful websites for notable agencies and startups, right now I'm working independantly on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/thekayshawn).

Landing pages, Portals, APIs, CMS, DB, Pipelines, Docker—I got you covered.

Inquiries are always welcome at [kashanahmad.me@gmail.com](mailto:kashanahmad.me@gmail.com). Alternatively, you can schedule a direct chit-chat using my [calendar](https://calendly.com/thekayshawn).

I ♥ open-source and have shipped 4 open-source projects myself (so far):

- ✨ [Glimmer](https://github.com/sassywares/glimmer) - Production-ready Next.js starter.
- 🍞 [Crust](https://github.com/sassywares/crust) - Simple TypeScript library starter.
- 🌴 [Trunk](https://github.com/sassywares/trunk) - Sassy-little-set of Javascript utilities.
- 🚑 [Medic](https://github.com/sassywares/medic) - Minimal Tailwind Plugin for consistent styling.

I work from my home in Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan, and live a pretty normal life. Thanks for standing by, let me know if you have any suggestions or... just wanna talk, I got you 😃
