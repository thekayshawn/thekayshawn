I’m an Experienced Frontend Developer with a proven track record of working with Startups, Agencies, and an Academy.

I've been an active Open Source Collaborator and have shipped 3 of my own libraries (so far)

- [Crust](https://github.com/sassywares/crust) - A simple boilerplate for creating and publishing packages to NPM.
- [Trunk](https://github.com/sassywares/trunk) - A sassy-little-set of utilities for JavaScript applications.
- [Medic](https://github.com/sassywares/medic) - A minimal Tailwind Plugin that brings consistent, cross-breakpoint utilities to your applications.

I’ve built Accessible Frontends of all sorts throughout my career, including Interactive Dashboards, Chat Systems, Landing Pages, Dynamic SPAs, and many others.

I've mastered the art of Responsive Web Design (RWD), Website Performance, and Analytics, and I specialize in semantic HTML and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

I’ve taught CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind at an academy and continue to learn and practice the new advancements in CSS.

I’ve spent years working with JavaScript as my go-to language and specialize in TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Astro.js, as well as integrating APIs, Serverless Back-Ends, and 3rd Party Services.

I've written unit, integration, and e2e tests for my JavaScript applications using Jest, Vitest, and Cypress, as well as have been a strong advocate for Test Driven Development (TDD) and Test After Development (TAD).

I've written CI/CD pipelines for GitHub Actions, BitBucket Pipelines, and Railway, as well as deployed and managed containerized stacks using K8s and Docker.

I’ve used Trello, JIRA, Clickup, GitHub Projects, and Monday as Project Management tools for companies I’ve worked with.

I’ve been an efficient, asynchronous remote developer and collaborator for the past 5 years.

I share my thoughts on X, LinkedIn, and my Blog (https://kashanahmad.me/blog), say hello.

I’m Open to Work, and I’m interviewing with companies promoting Remote Work, Open Source, Collaboration, and Growth.
